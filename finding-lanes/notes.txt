Gradient: Measure of change in brightness over adjacent pixels

Strong gradient: 0 -> 255
Small gradient:  0 -> 15 


Starting from left-top corner
X = width  (row)
Y = height (column)

derivate(f(x,y)) -> measures adjacent changes in intensity in all directions
The displayed edge represents a high change in intensity, exceeding the threshold


Line equation -> y = mx + b


Identifying lines on gradient images:

Hough Space -> coordinates based on B(y) and M(x) 

We will take the the gradient image which has a series of white points representing edges in our image space.
To identify the lines, ww will take those points and represent the candidate lines on the hough space,
by splitting the houghspace into a grid we will have multiple bins (squares) with crossing lines. The bin with highest count
of intersections will be the M and B values for our line that best fits our data.

Use Rho and Theta to find our line without getting mathematical issues

ρ <- Rho
Θ <- Theta
Line that best fits data => ρ = x*cos(Θ) + y*sin(Θ)
