Dead ReLU
    The ReLU activation function can sometimes "die" and only feeds a value of 0 to de posterior nodes.

ELU activation function
    Is exactly like the ReLU in the positive region, however in the negative region the ELU returns a negative number.
    - ELU has a non-zero gradient value in the negative region.
    - The ELU function has the chance to recover and fix its weight parameters
