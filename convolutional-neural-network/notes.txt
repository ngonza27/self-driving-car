Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN ConvNets)
    - Convolution is a mathematical way of combining two signals to form a third signal.
    - Most popular deep learning architecture
    - Most effective at face recognition, object detection, identifing objects.
     
CNN layers:
    Feature extraction: Convolutional Layer and Pooling Layer.
    Classication: Fully connected layers.

    Layers:
    - Input layer
    
    - Convolutional layer - main buildin block
        - Extract and learn specific image features, features that can be used to classify an image.
        - Each pixel is proccesed by a convolutional filter (Kernel/Kernel Matrix)
            [Kernel - a feature detector]
        - 3x3 kernel => 3 by 3 convolution
        - Perform convolutional opperation by sliding he kernel at every location of the image.
          The amount by which we're shifting the kernel at every opertaion is known as the Stryde.
          Ex: Stryde of 1, the kernel matrix moves one pixel at a time.
        - Kernel matrix is multiplied and averaged for every checked Stryde in order to fill the feature map.
        - The more Kernels we have, more features we can identify.
        - The depth of the kernel must match the depth of the image.
    
    - Pooling layers
        Shrink the image stack by reducing the dimensionality of the representation of each feature map,
        thereby reducing the computational complexity of the model
        - Helps reduce overfitting by reducing the number of parameters and computations in the network
          by providing a more abstracted generalised representation of the feature map.
        - Max pooling -> reports the maximum value within a rectangular neighborhood
    
    - Fully connected layers
         Fully connected network is responsible in taking these features as inputs, processing them to obtain
         a final probability as to what class the image belongs to.

    - Output layer



Relu Function
    Returns a value of zero if the input is negative, if the input is positive, it will return the same value
    - y=0
    - y=x

LeNet
    Was an architecture originaly designed to be able to recognize handwriten numbers on checks
    - Has the bas architecture ofe CNN: 
      input-> convolutional layer1 -> pool1 -> convolutional layer2 -> pool2 -> Fully connected layer-> output

    Note:   more filters -> more parameters -> more computing power
            Conv2D Parameters:
                - Use the padding argument when there is relevant information at the borders of the image.
                - Stride: default value = 1


Drop Out Layers
    Will randomly turn off the communication of some neurons in order to force the network to learn an adapt to the data and improving the overall weight distribution and accuracy.
    - Drop Out Layers are offten placed between layers with high number of parameters.
    - parameters: fraction rate = amount of input nodes that the dropout layer drops during each update (0.5 is recomended)
